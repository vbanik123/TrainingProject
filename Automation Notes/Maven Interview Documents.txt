What is Maven:
* maven is project management tool that is based on POM(project object model). It is used for project build, dependency and documentation.
* It simplifies the build process.

Why Maven Required :
* Maven project eliminates the Adding set of jars in each project.
* It creates correct project Structure.
* Building and Deploying the project is very simple.

What is Build Tool:
A build tool takes care of everything for building a sprocess. it does follwing:
* Generate source code.
* Compiles source code.
* Packages compiled code into JAR or ZIP files.
* Installs the packaged code into local repository, server repository or central repository.

Maven Installation:
How to install Maven in Windows Machine
* Download maven and extract it.
* Add JAVA_HOME and MAVEN_HOME in environment variable.
* Add maven path in environment variable.
* Verify Maven in Command prompt.

Verify Maven:
To verify whether the maven is installed or not, open the command prompt and write: mvn -version
It will show the below information in the command prompt(Note: versions may be different for the different machine and user)

Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T22:11:47+05:30)
Maven home: F:\SoftWare\apache-maven-3.3.9\bin\..
Java version: 1.8.0_151, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_151\jre

Maven Repository:
There are 3 types of Maven Repository
* Local Repository
* Central Repository
* Remote Repository

Maven search for the dependencies in the following order;
Local Repository then Central Repository and then  Remote Repository

Local Repository: Means .m2 folder in your system
Central repository: Maven Central Repository is located on the web. It has been created by the apache Maaven community itself.
Remote Repository: Company specific Library or Custom Libraray.

POM:
POM structure
If you see the POM xml you will find different parameter in the XML. below is the description of those parameters.

Project: It is the root element of pom.xml file.
Model Version: It is the sub Element of project. it specifies the model Version. It should be set to 4.0.0
Group ID : It will identify your project uniquely across all projects(com.test.selenium)
Artifact ID: Project Name
Packaging: defines packaging type such as jar,war etc.
Dependencies: define dependencies for current project.
Dependency: defines a dependency. It is used inside Dependencies.
Scope: Defines scope for this maven project. It can be compiled, provided, runtime, test, and system.

Maven Life Cycle:
* Validate - Validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
* Compile - Compile the source code of the project.
* Test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These test should not require the code be packaged or deployed.
* package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as jar.
* verify - run any checks on result of the integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met.
* install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
* deploy - done in the build environment copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
