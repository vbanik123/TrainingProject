Cucumber

Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework. It defines application behaviour using simple English text, defined by a language called Gherkin.
Cucumber allows automation functional validation that is easily read and understood. Cucumber was initially implemented in Ruby and then extended to Java framework. Both the tools support native JUnit.


In order to get better advantage of the software testing, organizations are nowadays taking a step forward. They implement important acceptance test scenarios while development is in-progress. This approach is commonly known as Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).
Behaviour Driven Development gives us an opportunity to create test scripts from both the developer’s and the customer’s prospective as well. So, in the beginning, developers, project managers, QAs, user acceptance testers and the product owner (stockholder), all get together and brainstorm about which test scenarios should be passed in order to call this software/application successful. This way they come up with a set of test scenarios. All these test scripts are in simple English language, so it serves the purpose of documentation also.

Example
If we are developing a user authentication feature, then the following can be few key test scenarios, which needs to get passed in order to call it a success.
•	The user should be able to login with correct username and correct password.
•	The user should not be able to login with incorrect username and correct password.
•	The user should not be able to login with correct username and incorrect password.
Advantages of Cucumber Over Other Tools
•	Cucumber supports different languages like Java.net and Ruby.
•	It acts as a bridge between the business and technical language. We can accomplish this by creating a test case in plain English text.
•	It allows the test script to be written without knowledge of any code, it allows the involvement of non-programmers as well.
•	It serves the purpose of end-to-end test framework unlike other tools.
•	Due to simple test script architecture, Cucumber provides code reusability.

Gherkin
---------
The language, in which this executable feature files is written, is known as Gherkin. Gherkin is a plain English text language, which helps the tool - Cucumber to interpret and execute the test scripts.

Feature 
---------
A Feature can be defined as a standalone unit or functionality of a project. 


Feature Files
---------------
The file, in which Cucumber tests are written, is known as feature files. It is advisable that there should be a separate feature file, for each feature under test. The extension of the feature file needs to be “. feature”.
One can create as many feature files as needed. To have an organized structure, each feature should have one feature file.
For Example −
Sr.No |	Feature	       |   Feature File name
1	  | User Login	   |   userLogin.feature
2	  | Registration   |   registration.feature
3	  | Add Product	   |   addProduct.feature
4	  | Delete Account |   deleteAccount.feature


The naming convention to be used for feature name, feature file name depends on the individual’s choice. There is no ground rule in Cucumber about names.
A simple feature file consists of the following keywords/parts −
•	Feature − Name of the feature under test.
•	Description (optional) − Describe about feature under test.
•	Scenario − What is the test scenario.
•	Given − Prerequisite before the test steps get executed.
•	When − Specific condition which should match in order to execute the next step.
•	Then − What should happen if the condition mentioned in WHEN is satisfied.

Now come to the technical side. First we will create the maven project. Now update the pom.xml with neccessary dependencies.

First we will have the cucumber dependencies.
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-java -->

Apart from that we need to download one plugins so that we can get proper syntax when we will write feature file. For that we will go to the help menu and go to marketplace and here in the find option search cucumber it will give it will give you the cucumber eclipse pugin, you need to install that eclipse plugin. The other approach is in the help menu go to the install new software and here you cucumber it will give you some link just copy that and press add. A add repository popup will poped up give some name and paste the link and click ok. you will get the cucmber eclipse plugin and install it. Once you complete it right click on pom.xml and choose run as maven it will install all the dependencies mentioned in the pom.xml and update the project.

How to create the feature file
---------------------------------

Right click on the project go to properties, go to java build path - > sources -> click on Add Folder -> go to the src main -> click on create on new folder -> name it any name like resources -> click on OK - > apply. Right Click on Resources folder -> Click on folder -> name the folder as Features File - > Again right click on Features File folder and click on File to create a feature file name the file as Demo.feature - > Click on finish.

The main aim of the Behavior Driven Development framework is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, etc., understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.

Q #2) What language is used by Cucumber?

Answer: Gherkin is the language that is used by the Cucumber tool. It is a simple English representation of the application behavior. Gherkin language uses several keywords to describe the behavior of applications such as Feature, Scenario, Scenario Outline, Given, When, Then, etc.

Q #3) What is meant by a feature file?

Answer: A feature file must provide a high-level description of an Application Under Test (AUT). The first line of the feature file must start with the keyword ‘Feature’ followed by the description of the application under test.

A feature file may include multiple scenarios within the same file. A feature file has the extension .feature.

Q #4) What are the various keywords that are used in Cucumber for writing a scenario?

Answer: Mentioned below are the keywords that are used for writing a scenario:

Given
When
Then
And
Q #5) What is the purpose of a Scenario Outline in Cucumber?

Answer: Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. This is ideally used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.

Q #6) What programming language is used by Cucumber?

Answer: Cucumber tool provides support for multiple programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby etc. It can also be integrated with multiple tools such as Selenium, Capybara, etc.

Q #7) What is the purpose of the Step Definition file in Cucumber?

Answer: A step definition file in Cucumber is used to segregate the feature files from the underlying code. Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.

While feature files are written in an easily understandable language like, Gherkin, Step Definition files are written in programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby, etc.

Q #8) What are the major advantages of the Cucumber framework?

Answer: Given below are the advantages of the Cucumber Gherkin framework that make Cucumber an ideal choice for rapidly evolving Agile methodology in today’s corporate world.

Scenario: Login to the application.

Open the Chrome browser and launch the application.
When the user enters the username onto the UserName field.
And User enters the password into the Password field.
When the user clicks on the Login button.
Then validate if the user login is successful.
Q #10) Provide an example of a Scenario Outline using the Cucumber framework.

Answer: The following is an example of a Scenario Outline keyword for the scenario ‘Upload a file’. The number of parameter values to be included in the feature file is based on the tester’s choice.

Scenario Outline: Upload a file

Given that the user is on upload file screen.
When a user clicks on the Browse button.
And user enters <filename> onto the upload textbox.
And user clicks on the enter button.
Then verify that the file upload is successful.
